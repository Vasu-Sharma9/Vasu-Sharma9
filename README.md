## 🌱 About Me  

I love exploring how data, design, and engineering work together to solve real problems and occasionally create new ones. Currently diving into analytics, consulting, and product development to turn data into decisions (and maybe a few insights worth bragging about).

## 🧠 Over time, I’ve been learning to  

- analyze and visualize data with **Python**, **Power BI**, and **Excel**  
- work with **SQL** and **Pandas** for data handling  
- explore **Machine Learning**  
- build responsive UIs with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Streamlit**  
- create designs with **Canva**, **Figma**, and **Adobe**
